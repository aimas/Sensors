# Sensors
Programs I created on Raspberry PI for handling sensors, mostly written in Python or JAVA, maybe some C at a later point.

Just starting with github, so please bare this in mind:-).

All programs are GNU Licenses and can be used, shared, modified at your pleasure.

I'm definitely open for suggetions and improvements. The programs will start from very easy to maybe a bit more complex later.
